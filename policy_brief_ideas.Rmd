# Official harvest intensities are not sustainable

Timber volumes do not recover a 10-20 m3/ha harvest in 35 years (Brazilian Amazon // Peru, Bolivia: even less, 20 years cycle), even if we harvest all species with potential commercial value

```{r, fig.cap="Maximum proprotion of timber recovery in Amazonia after a 20 m3/ha harvest at the end of a 30 years cutting cycle. All trees > 50 cm dbh from species with potential commercial value are considered as timber."}

# Overharvesting will lead to stock depletion in just a few decades

at current rates: timber stocks in available production forests will be gone by 20XX => need to find a solution

![](graphs/temp_timber_decrease.png)

-> adapt with 20 m3 in the first year then 10 m3/yr

#	Drastic reduction in harvest levels are needed

-> reduce to ca. 10 m3/ha every 65 years to maintain stocks [plus account for regional variability?]
(cf previous figure)

#	Reducing harvest intensities will not be enough to meet current timber demands

=> not enough area to maintain current production rates (~ 20-30 Mm3 in the whole region/ better estimates?)
total available area: 190 Mha
total production per ha per year: 10/65 x 60% (area suitable for logging in a concession) => max production = 190 x 10/65 x 0.58 = 17 Mm3 < target

# Possible future trajectories 

2 potential trajectories to harvest the timber-production target: 

- drastically increase the area available (potential consequences on other ecosystem services, in particular for biodiversity conservation) 

- or increase silviculture and restoration of degraded forests -> will probably need fundings (eg through payments for environmental services)


#	Intensive forest management and climate change adaptation

betting on natural forests for future timber production = risky (climate changes, fires, etc: what will we have tomorrow?) // intensively managed forests (plantations, restored forests) can be managed to increase adaptation to foreseen changes (through species selection, etc)
