@article{Potapov2017,
abstract = {An intact forest landscape (IFL) is a seamless mosaic of forest and naturally treeless ecosystems with no remotely detected signs of human activity and a minimum area of 500 km(2). IFLs are critical for stabilizing terrestrial carbon storage, harboring biodiversity, regulating hydrological regimes, and providing other ecosystem functions. Although the remaining IFLs comprise only 20{\%} of tropical forest area, they account for 40{\%} of the total aboveground tropical forest carbon. We show that global IFL extent has been reduced by 7.2{\%} since the year 2000. An increasing rate of global IFL area reduction was found, largely driven by the tripling of IFL tropical forest loss in 2011-2013 compared to that in 2001-2003. Industrial logging, agricultural expansion, fire, and mining/resource extraction were the primary causes of IFL area reduction. Protected areas (International Union for Conservation of Nature categories I to III) were found to have a positive effect in slowing the reduction of IFL area from timber harvesting but were less effective in limiting agricultural expansion. The certification of logging concessions under responsible management had a negligible impact on slowing IFL fragmentation in the Congo Basin. Fragmentation of IFLs by logging and establishment of roads and other infrastructure initiates a cascade of changes that lead to landscape transformation and loss of conservation values. Given that only 12{\%} of the global IFL area is protected, our results illustrate the need for planning and investment in carbon sequestration and biodiversity conservation efforts that target the most valuable remaining forests, as identified using the IFL approach.},

@article{DeAvila2017,
abstract = {Sustainable production of timber from commercial species across felling cycles is a core challenge for tropical silviculture. In this study, we analysed how the intensity and type (harvesting and thinning) of silvicultural interventions affect: (a) recruitment of small stems (5 cm ⩽ DBH {\textless} 15 cm), (b) increment of future crop trees (15 cm ⩽ DBH {\textless} 50 cm) and (c) recovery of harvestable growing stocks (DBH ⩾ 50 cm) of 52 commercial timber species in the Tapaj{\'{o}}s National Forest, Brazil. Intervention intensities comprised logging (on average 61 m3 ha−1) and associated damage to remaining trees (1982) and thinning (refinement) to reduce basal area at the stand level (1993/1994). These interventions together resulted in a gradient of reduction in basal-area from 19 to 53{\%} relative to pre-logging stocks. Trees (DBH ⩾ 5 cm) were measured on eight occasions in 41 permanent sample plots of 0.25 ha each. The dynamics were analysed at the stand level over 30 years and compared among treatments (including unlogged forest) and to pre-logging stands. Recruitment and growth temporarily increased following interventions and recovery of harvestable growing stock decreased with intervention intensity. Harvesting substantially increased recruitment of small stems relative to the unlogged forest, but recruitment rates decreased over time and did not increase following thinning. Gross increment of future crop trees was higher in logged than in unlogged forest and increased over time with high intensity of follow-up thinning, where it remained significantly higher than in control plots over time. Increased recruitment rates and volume increments were mainly driven by long-lived pioneer species, changing the composition of the growing stock. In 2012, recovery of harvestable growing stock of the 22 species harvested in 1982 varied between 19{\%} and 57{\%} in logged treatments relative to pre-logging levels. When considering an additional group of 30 species that were not harvested in the permanent sample plots but are now potentially commercial, relative recovery increased enough to support a second harvest under the present regulations (maximum harvest of 30 m3 ha−1), except for treatment with high thinning intensity where stocks were still less than 30{\%} relative to pre-harvest levels. In contrast, light and medium thinning intensity promoted recovery of harvestable growing stock. These findings indicate that intensive thinning should be avoided and silvicultural interventions oriented towards future crop trees of target species should be adopted. This may enhance recovery and reduce unintended changes in composition of the commercial growing stock.},

@article{Putz2012,
abstract = {Most tropical forests outside protected areas have been or will be selectively logged so it is essential to maximize the conservation values of partially harvested areas. Here we examine the extent to which these forests sustain timber production, retain species, and conserve carbon stocks. We then describe some improvements in tropical forestry and how their implementation can be promoted. -{\'{a}}A simple meta-analysis based on {\textgreater}100 publications revealed substantial variability but that: timber yields decline by about 46{\%} after the first harvest but are subsequently sustained at that level; 76{\%} of carbon is retained in once-logged forests; and, 85G{\c{C}}{\^{o}}100{\%} of species of mammals, birds, invertebrates, and plants remain after logging. Timber stocks will not regain primary-forest levels within current harvest cycles, but yields increase if collateral damage is reduced and silvicultural treatments are applied. -{\'{a}}Given that selectively logged forests retain substantial biodiversity, carbon, and timber stocks, this G{\c{C}}{\pounds}middle wayG{\c{C}}¥ between deforestation and total protection deserves more attention from researchers, conservation organizations, and policy-makers. Improvements in forest management are now likely if synergies are enhanced among initiatives to retain forest carbon stocks (REDD+), assure the legality of forest products, certify responsible management, and devolve control over forests to empowered local communities},

State, territory and private forest owners and managers collect primary forest data, and the National Forest Inventory is responsible for collating and translating these into national datasets.
