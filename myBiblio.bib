@article{Potapov2017,
abstract = {An intact forest landscape (IFL) is a seamless mosaic of forest and naturally treeless ecosystems with no remotely detected signs of human activity and a minimum area of 500 km(2). IFLs are critical for stabilizing terrestrial carbon storage, harboring biodiversity, regulating hydrological regimes, and providing other ecosystem functions. Although the remaining IFLs comprise only 20{\%} of tropical forest area, they account for 40{\%} of the total aboveground tropical forest carbon. We show that global IFL extent has been reduced by 7.2{\%} since the year 2000. An increasing rate of global IFL area reduction was found, largely driven by the tripling of IFL tropical forest loss in 2011-2013 compared to that in 2001-2003. Industrial logging, agricultural expansion, fire, and mining/resource extraction were the primary causes of IFL area reduction. Protected areas (International Union for Conservation of Nature categories I to III) were found to have a positive effect in slowing the reduction of IFL area from timber harvesting but were less effective in limiting agricultural expansion. The certification of logging concessions under responsible management had a negligible impact on slowing IFL fragmentation in the Congo Basin. Fragmentation of IFLs by logging and establishment of roads and other infrastructure initiates a cascade of changes that lead to landscape transformation and loss of conservation values. Given that only 12{\%} of the global IFL area is protected, our results illustrate the need for planning and investment in carbon sequestration and biodiversity conservation efforts that target the most valuable remaining forests, as identified using the IFL approach.},

@article{Sist2007,
abstract = {Damage caused by reduced-impact logging (RIL) was assessed in 18 plots 1 ha each in a terra firme rain forest of Eastern Amazon (Brazil, Paragominas). Mean logging intensity was 6 trees ha-1 and the resulting commercial volume 21 m3 ha-1. On average, logging damage affected 16{\%} of the original stand while skidtrails occupied 7{\%} (661 m2 ha-1) of forest soil area. Canopy openness doubled to a mean of 11{\%}. Of the variables studied, "number of trees harvested or felled per plot" gave the best correlation to "proportion of damaged or destroyed trees". Damage to each diameter class was distributed in accordance with relative abundance of trees (dbh ??? 20 cm) in the original population before logging, suggesting that all diameter classes were affected equally. The sustainability of timber management applying RIL was evaluated through the calculation of the recovery level of commercial trees in three different scenarios. In the most optimistic scenario (growth rate of 5 mm year-1 and 1{\%} annual mortality), after 30 years, only 50{\%} of the commercial stand would recover, provoking a drastic reduction of the harvesting intensity at the second felling cycle. Within a 30-year felling cycle (i.e. the legal felling cycle duration in the Brazilian Amazon) and even under RIL systems, the present logging intensity occurring in the study area (6 trees ha-1) is not compatible with sustainable yield production on a long-term basis. For the study area, only the implementation of silvicultural treatment ensuring that the remaining potential crop trees grow at 4-5 mm year-1 would guarantee a logging intensity of 3-4 trees ha-1 (10-14 m3 ha-1) 40 years after the first harvest. This study showed that in the Amazon, RIL alone is clearly not sufficient to achieve sustainable forest management. More sophisticated silvicultural systems must be urgently elaborated and implemented to ensure that the forest will still be sustainably managed on a long-term basis. This issue is particularly important in the case of Brazil as a new law allowing the creation of 500,000 km2 of forest concessions by 2010 has been recently approved by the congress. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Declining deforestation rates in the Brazilian Amazon are touted as a conservation success, but illegal logging is a problem of similar scale. Recent regulatory efforts have improved detection of some forms of illegal logging but are vulnerable to more subtle methods that mask the origin of illegal timber. We analyzed discrepancies between estimated timber volumes of the national forest inventory of Brazil and volumes of logging permits as an indicator of potential fraud in the timber industry in the eastern Amazon. We found a strong overestimation bias of high-value timber species volumes in logging permits. Field assessments confirmed fraud for the most valuable species and complementary strategies to generate a “surplus” of licensed timber that can be used to legalize the timber coming from illegal logging. We advocate for changes to the logging control system to prevent overexploitation of Amazonian timber species and the widespread forest degradation associated with illegal logging.},

Despite recent efforts to achieve sustainability, such as provisions in the US-Peru Trade Promotion Agreement, illegal logging continues to plague the region. We present evidence that Peru's legal logging concession system is enabling the widespread illegal logging via the regulatory documents designed to ensure sustainable logging. Analyzing official government data, we found that 68.3{\%} of all concessions supervised by authorities were suspected of major violations. Of the 609 total concessions, nearly 30{\%} have been cancelled for violations and we expect this percentage to increase as investigations continue. Moreover, the nature of the violations indicate that the permits associated with legal concessions are used to harvest trees in unauthorized areas, thus threatening all forested areas. Many of the violations pertain to the illegal extraction of CITES-listed timber species outside authorized areas. These findings highlight the need for additional reforms.},

@article{DeAvila2017,
abstract = {Sustainable production of timber from commercial species across felling cycles is a core challenge for tropical silviculture. In this study, we analysed how the intensity and type (harvesting and thinning) of silvicultural interventions affect: (a) recruitment of small stems (5 cm ⩽ DBH {\textless} 15 cm), (b) increment of future crop trees (15 cm ⩽ DBH {\textless} 50 cm) and (c) recovery of harvestable growing stocks (DBH ⩾ 50 cm) of 52 commercial timber species in the Tapaj{\'{o}}s National Forest, Brazil. Intervention intensities comprised logging (on average 61 m3 ha−1) and associated damage to remaining trees (1982) and thinning (refinement) to reduce basal area at the stand level (1993/1994). These interventions together resulted in a gradient of reduction in basal-area from 19 to 53{\%} relative to pre-logging stocks. Trees (DBH ⩾ 5 cm) were measured on eight occasions in 41 permanent sample plots of 0.25 ha each. The dynamics were analysed at the stand level over 30 years and compared among treatments (including unlogged forest) and to pre-logging stands. Recruitment and growth temporarily increased following interventions and recovery of harvestable growing stock decreased with intervention intensity. Harvesting substantially increased recruitment of small stems relative to the unlogged forest, but recruitment rates decreased over time and did not increase following thinning. Gross increment of future crop trees was higher in logged than in unlogged forest and increased over time with high intensity of follow-up thinning, where it remained significantly higher than in control plots over time. Increased recruitment rates and volume increments were mainly driven by long-lived pioneer species, changing the composition of the growing stock. In 2012, recovery of harvestable growing stock of the 22 species harvested in 1982 varied between 19{\%} and 57{\%} in logged treatments relative to pre-logging levels. When considering an additional group of 30 species that were not harvested in the permanent sample plots but are now potentially commercial, relative recovery increased enough to support a second harvest under the present regulations (maximum harvest of 30 m3 ha−1), except for treatment with high thinning intensity where stocks were still less than 30{\%} relative to pre-harvest levels. In contrast, light and medium thinning intensity promoted recovery of harvestable growing stock. These findings indicate that intensive thinning should be avoided and silvicultural interventions oriented towards future crop trees of target species should be adopted. This may enhance recovery and reduce unintended changes in composition of the commercial growing stock.},

@techreport{SFB2019,
abstract = {Since 1998, the National Forest Inventory (NFI) has been collecting and communicating information on Australia's forests. Its mission is to be the authoritative source of information for national and regional monitoring and reporting and to support decision-making on all of Australia's forests. The NFI undertakes national forest assessments and reporting such as the State of the Forests report. It is a collaborative partnership between the Australian, State and Territory governments. State, territory and private forest owners and managers collect primary forest data, and the National Forest Inventory is responsible for collating and translating these into national datasets. The majority of inventory and monitoring activities in native forests have focused on areas managed for commercial wood production. The largest gaps in forest information are in privately managed forests and in areas managed for non-wood attributes.},
